Due to restrictions from the [KubeSphere License](https://github.com/openksc/kubesphere/blob/master/LICENSE) and registered trademarks, we’re unable to publicly redistribute the recompiled source code. For now, I’ve re-uploaded [some of the images](https://hub.docker.com/u/openksc) previously released by KubeSphere, reorganized and shared [the code previously forked by the community](https://github.com/orgs/openksc/repositories), and put together [user documentation](https://openksc.github.io) for the last available version (v4.1.3) as a temporary resource for the community.

I’m both outraged and baffled by KubeSphere’s abrupt decision to go closed-source. Not only does this go against the very spirit of open source, but it’s also a betrayal of the trust that so many developers and users placed in the project. Honestly, I can't understand what kind of fool would make such a short-sighted and stupid decision.

As a former contributor, I’ve always believed in KubeSphere as a product—the new 4.x architecture was truly impressive. It’s deeply regrettable to see such a flagship Chinese open source project squandered like this.

This doesn’t just hurt KubeSphere’s developers and users—it also undermines the basic trust people have in Chinese open source projects as a whole. Profiting is one thing, but this is just disgraceful.

受限于[KubeSphere License](https://github.com/openksc/kubesphere/blob/master/LICENSE) 和注册商标的限制，我们无法对源码重新编译后**公开进行分发**。目前我重新上传了 KubeSphere 之前发布的[部分镜像](https://hub.docker.com/u/openksc)，重新整理并上传了[大家之前 fork 的代码](https://github.com/orgs/openksc/repositories)，构建了最后一个版本（v4.1.3）的[用户文档](https://openksc.github.io)，供大家应急使用。

我对 KubeSphere 断崖式的闭源行为感到愤慨和不解。且不说这种损人不利己的行为和开源精神相违背，我愤慨，他辜负了广大开发者和开源用户的信任！我不解，到底是什么样的人才能做出这样短视且愚蠢的决策！

作为曾经的贡献者，打心底是认可 KubeSphere 这个产品的，4.x 新的架构让人眼前一亮。但真的是太遗憾了，作为国人开源的明星项目，如今被这样糟蹋着实觉得惋惜。

这不仅仅伤害的是 KubeSphere 的开发者和用户，更影响了大家对中国开源项目最基本的信任。商业化无可厚非，请不要这么没有下限。
